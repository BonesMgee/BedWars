# ScreamingBedWars

Flexible BedWars plugin, formerly coded as a replacement for BedwarsRel.

Supported versions: \[1.9.4 - 1.17.1\], recommended versions: \[1.16.5/1.17.1\].

### Current multiplatform goal

We are working on rewriting our plugin to our new library ScreamingLib. This allows us to port our plugin to new platforms such as Minestom, Sponge, Forge or even Nukkit.
