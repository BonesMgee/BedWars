# ScreamingBedWars

Flexible BedWars plugin formerly coded as a replacement for BedwarsRel.

Supported versions: \[1.9.4 - 1.17.1\]. Recommended version: \[1.16.5/1.17.1\]

If you are using version 0.2.x, you are probably looking for this [branch](https://github.com/ScreamingSandals/BedWars/tree/ver/0.2.x)

### Current multiplatform goal

We are working on rewriting our plugin to our new library ScreamingLib. This allows us to port our plugin to new platforms such as Minestom, Sponge, Forge or even Nukkit.

## Support
If you need any help, you can contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4xB54Ts). Please make sure to look into older messages. There are many question already answered. It is really anoying to repeat the same thing over and over.

Make sure to check out our [wiki](https://github.com/ScreamingSandals/BedWars/wiki) before contacting us on Discord. It will save our time, you know.
