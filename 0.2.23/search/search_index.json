Creating the arena \u00b6 Create the arena by executing this command: /bw admin <arena name> add . Setting the arena positions \u00b6 To set the first position, go into the first corner of your map and execute this command: /bw admin <arena name> pos1 . To set the second position, go into the second corner of your map and execute this command: /bw admin <arena name> pos2 . Positions pos1 is one corner of the arena and pos2 is the corner of the arena, that is opposing to pos1 ! Adding teams \u00b6 Now it's time to add the teams. To add a team, do /bw admin <arena> team add <team name> <team colour> <team size> . For the colors, you can use this TeamColor enum: RED , BLUE , GREEN , YELLOW , MAGENTA , PINK , LIME , BLACK , WHITE , ORANGE , LIGHT_GRAY , GRAY , LIGHT_BLUE , CYAN and BROWN . Warning You must create at least 2 teams. Setting team spawns \u00b6 Stand where you would like to have the team spawn, and look in the direction that you want your players to be oriented when they spawn, as the yaw will also be taken into account. Set the team's spawn with this command: /bw admin <arena> team spawn <team> and repeat until all teams have a spawn. Setting the team bed \u00b6 Stand on top of the bed, look down on the head of the bed and execute this command to set the bed location: /bw admin <arena name> team bed <team name> . Repeat until all teams have a bed. Target blocks The team's target block isn't limited to a bed, in fact BedWars has support for any block (the Dragon Egg, cakes and the Respawn Anchor have special support to allow BedWars to operate as EggWars, AnchorWars or CakeWars out of the box). Adding resource generators \u00b6 Stand at the block where you want the generator to be and execute this command: /bw admin <arena name> spawner add <resource> <true/false> . Valid default resources: bronze , iron and gold (diamond and emerald is not included out of the box, you will have to add it yourself in the configuration ). The true/false part of the command means if there should be a hologram (true) or if there should be no hologram (false). Adding merchants \u00b6 Now it's time to add the shops. Stand where you would like your shop entity to be, look forward and execute this command: /bw admin <arena> store add <name of villager entity> [file with shop] [use main shop] (last two command parts can be omitted). Example: /bw admin <arena> store add &aStore shop.yml false , /bw admin <arena> store add &aStore Store entity types If you would like to have a different entity as the store, do the following: /bw admin <arena> store type <living entity> . This sets entity type of store (Villager, Horse, Cow, etc.). If you would like to have a player with a skin as the shop keeper, use this command: /bw admin <arena> store type Player:skinname . Final steps \u00b6 Add the lobby location for the arena by executing this command: /bw admin <arena> lobby . Add the spectator location for the arena by executing this command: /bw admin <arena> spec . Last but not least, remember to save the arena with /bw admin <arena> save .","title":"Arena creation"},{"location":"arena/#making-an-arena","text":"World This tutorial presumes that you already have a world with your desired BedWars map, loaded with a plugin like Multiverse or SlimeWorldManager and that you already are in the world with your BedWars map.","title":"Making an arena"},{"location":"arena/#creating-the-arena","text":"Create the arena by executing this command: /bw admin <arena name> add .","title":"Creating the arena"},{"location":"arena/#setting-the-arena-positions","text":"To set the first position, go into the first corner of your map and execute this command: /bw admin <arena name> pos1 .

Non-OP players can't do some things in spawn protection. Position 1 and Position 2 \u00b6 These two positions serve to designate an area to be considered an arena. (such as axe in WorldEdit) See the Arena Bed cannot be destroyed \u00b6 BedWars allows you to use any block as the target block, so you won't see any error when you set it to, for example, floor. So check it, and make you sure you're looking at the bed head when setting the team target block. Adding a sign \u00b6 Place a sign and write [BedWars] or [BWGame] (case-sensitive) as the first line, and the name of your arena as the second line. Make sure that your sign is not in range of vanilla's spawn protection. Automatically coloring a shop item \u00b6 Use the applycolorbyteam property, for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - price : 1 price-type : bronze properties : - name : \"applycolorbyteam\" stack : type : WHITE_WOOL amount : 2 Upgrades \u00b6 See the Upgrades article. Language file \u00b6 See the Configuration article. PlaceholderAPI placeholders \u00b6 See the Placeholder API article. Changing the message prefix \u00b6 Prefix is changeable globally in the language file or per arena with this command: /bw admin <arena> customprefix &6My Awesome Prefix . Editing resources \u00b6 See the Configuration article. Broken shop \u00b6 Make sure your shop is YAML valid with yamlchecker , has proper materials and format . Compass teleports the player \u00b6 Well, you probably have WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit. The compass is used to teleport through walls. However it works only for people with permission or with OP. You can disable this tool or bound it to another item in WorldEdit configuration. You can also change the team selection item to another one in BedWars configuration. Permissions \u00b6 bw.admin - Allows you to create/edit an arena, reload the plugin and use the cheat command if enabled. bw.vip.startitem - Allows you to start the game using the item. All players will be automatically distributed to teams. bw.vip.forcejoin - Allows you to join even if the game is full (player without this permission will be kicked). bw.otherstats - Allows you to see stats of other players. bw.admin.alljoin - Allows you to use /bw alljoin command. bw.disable.joinall - Protects you from effects of /bw alljoin command. bw.cmd.join - Allows you to use /bw join command. bw.cmd.leave - Allows you to use /bw leave command. bw.cmd.stats - Allows you to use /bw stats command. bw.cmd.rejoin - Allows you to use /bw rejoin command. bw.cmd.autojoin - Allows you to use /bw autojoin command. bw.cmd.list - Allows you to use /bw list command. bw.cmd.leaderboard - Allows you to use /bw leaderboard command. Every permission can be prefixed with misat11. . Note that this egoism would eventually be removed in a future major release. All permissions starting with bw.cmd. are allowed by default even if the permission is not explicitly given. This can be changed in config.yml . Adding start and respawn items \u00b6 You can by doing the following Start game \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 game-start-items : true gived-game-start-items : - LEATHER_HELMET - LEATHER_BOOTS - LEATHER_LEGGINGS - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE - WOODEN_SWORD Respawn \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 player-respawn-items : true gived-player-respawn-items : - LEATHER_HELMET - LEATHER_BOOTS - LEATHER_LEGGINGS - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE - WOODEN_SWORD Villagers do not spawn \u00b6 Here is some info on how to troubleshoot this error: * Make sure that Mob Spawning is enabled * You are NOT protecting the arena with worldguard * Make sure that NPC's are enabled Are there any visual/particle effects? \u00b6 Yes, there are. Check out this page Changing damage or explosion power of Fireball \u00b6 Go in your config.yml and there are settings for the Fireball. It is located under specials, it is not that hard to find \ud83d\ude1b Same goes for basically any other special item. \ud83d\ude42 Setting up the plugin with Bungeecord \u00b6 Install bedwars on every game server . Open the config.yml file on every game server and modify bungee.enabled: true , bungee.server: yourBungeeLobbyServerName and bungee.auto-game-connect: true Setup an arena on every game server. On your lobby server you should setup some plugin for joining the arena. There are some recommended: Get BungeeSigns on your lobby server to teleport players to your game servers with signs. Get SimpleInventories on your lobby server to teleport players to your game server using menus. (You can also use any inventory plugin which supports sending players to other servers) Configure every game server to your liking. PvP does not work \u00b6 Make sure: * It is enabled in MultiVerse (or similar multi-world plugin) and if it is not do /mvm set pvp true <world name> . * WorldGuard does not disallow fighting in the world where the arena is located (if yes do /rg flag <region name> pvp allow ); * You have spawn-protection disabled (set it to 0 in server.properties). Keep in mind that BedWars does not moderate PvP . If PvP does not work for you, it is caused by a misconfiguration or another plugin. If tips above did not help you, please contact us on our Discord server. Players regenerate too quickly/swords deal very little damage \u00b6 That is not a BedWars issue, increase your server's game difficulty (from easy to normal for example). Changing arena name \u00b6 First, we will provide no support if you mess this up somehow, arena files are not supposed to be edited by people . 1. Go to your BedWars folder and then to arenas folder. The path should be plugins/BedWars/arenas 2. Open the file you want to change the name 3. First filled is name, enter your new one. The name cannot look like this test arena and always needs to be one string, that means test-arena . The name also must be unique, that means you cannot have two arenas with the same name. 4. Save the file 5. Restart or reload the server Kicked from server with strange errors \u00b6 That is not our fault. You are probably using version older than 1.9.4 . Nametags, scoreboars and others might be causing that. We don't support 1.8.x in any way. If you are still having this error on a newer version, feel free to contact us on our Discord server. Class version errors \u00b6 SomeClass has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0 (unable to load class SomeClass) This means you are using Java 8 (52.0), but the plugin requires at least Java 11 (55.0), if you want to know how to update, visit this page (It tells you about updating to Java 17 which can run software for Java 11; similar methods can be used for Java 11) Currently BedWars 0.2.23 does not require Java 11, however the most famous addon SBA requires at least Java 11. New version of BedWars (0.3.0+) will require at least Java 11. Using no (Norwegian) language \u00b6 Well, Yaml specification says that literal no means false . To use no as no , you need to cast it to string locale: \"no\" Players get disconnected from the bedwars game when they die or players respawn in the arena after reconnecting \u00b6 A plugin is overriding player spawns on your server, those might include (but not limited to) EssentialsSpawn, WorldGuard, etc. Remove those plugins or disable them in bedwars worlds.","title":"Troubleshooting and FAQ"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-and-faq","text":"","title":"Troubleshooting and FAQ"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#non-op-players-cannot-use-signs","text":"Move the sign out of vanilla spawn protection (for example, if you have the spawn protection in server.properties set to 16, move 34 blocks away from spawn location) or change spawn protection to zero.
